# CSC305
## Course Overview
An introduction to computer graphics by covering basic mathematical concepts such as 2D and 3D transformations, studying the interaction of light and geometry to derive shading models, and implementing rendering algorithms such as ray tracing and rasterization. The core of the course requires integrating these essential components into current graphics processors and learning the corresponding programming APIs using C++.

## Topics  
* 3D Transformations
* Viewing 3D scenes
* Shading
* Rendering pipeline and the GPU
* Texturing
* Polygonal meshes and other modelling techniques
* Colour spaces
* Light and colour
* Ray-geometry intersection
* Ray tracing
